## Project Title: CareerCone
careerCone is an organizational web tool that allows the job seeker to keep track of the resume used for specific job listings and track the entire job process from searching applicable positions to the ability to track interviews and resumes used to snag the final interview and get a call back.  

## Motivation
Looking for a job can almost be a job within itself. If a job seeker is not applying to multiple positions a week if not a day they will surely miss out on an opportunity in many of these heavely saturated job markets. When applying to multiple jobs it is often easy to forget which step of the process you are in with the many different positions at many different companies. Even keeping up with the different catered resumes and cover letters can be daunting and an overal hassle. With careerCone keeping track of your applications, interviews, resumes and cover letters getting ahead of the process just got a whole lot more manageable! 

## Build Status 
As for the functionality of the site it is fairly basic as of right now. The notes section although funtional are not fully synced up with resumes and can't as a whole. For future we hope to be able to send all the notes and things attatched to our application process to local storage and be rechievable alongside the resume and coverletter, position and company. We are also looking into adding more functionality to the progress bar which would be responsive to search, selection and dropdown button clicks as well as the uploading of documents. We would also like to make the calendar more responsive to interview appointments and reminders with alerts and other cool features.
