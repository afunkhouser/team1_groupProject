## Project Title: CareerCone
careerCone is an organizational web tool that will allow you to create a list of jobs that you have applied to with added features to keep track of the resume you used for that job listing 

## Motivation
When applying to multiple jobs it is often easy to forget which step of the process you are in with different companies. With careerCone keeping track of your job applications, interviews and resumes  is a whole lot easier! 

## Build Status 
The notes are currently not functional but we hope to get them to local storage and be rechievable alongside the resumes, position and company
We are also looking into adding more functionality to the progress bar which would be responsive to button clicks and uploading of documents
We would also like to make the calendar more responsive to interview appointments and reminders 

## code used 
HTML 
CSS
JAvascript 
(we also used BULMA)
